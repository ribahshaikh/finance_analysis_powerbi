# Finance KPI Dashboard in Power BI

## Overview

This project creates a Finance KPI Dashboard in Power BI to analyze financial performance. 

Key tasks include:

**Data Cleaning:** Fixed inconsistencies, handled missing values, and prepared data in Power Query.

**Transformation:** Built relationships between datasets and calculated metrics like variance and team performance.

**Visualization:** Designed interactive charts, tables, and slicers for actionable insights.

## Key Insights

1. Overall Performance: Achieved $18.9M sales, 1.9% below the $19.3M target, meeting goals in only 2 out of 14 months.
2. Monthly Trends: Peak sales months revealed replicable strategies, while consistent underperformance in others requires attention.
3. Team Analysis: Uneven contributions across teams highlight the need for targeted coaching and resource allocation.
4. High Variance: Significant gaps between actual and target sales in most months suggest a review of sales strategies.
5. Variance Impact: Variance trends align with specific months and individuals, providing a basis for corrective action.
6. Opportunities: Focus on replicating success factors from top months and improving sales efficiency in low-performing areas.

## Tools Used

1. Power BI (Visualizations, Power Query)
